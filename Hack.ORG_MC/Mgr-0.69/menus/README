The *.menu files can be load be using menu(1).

There is also an experimental menu for origami, which can be load using
m4.  I say experimental, because I may a) add some things next time and
b) Origami will support MGR in its next releases, so there will be
context sensitive menues rather than one global menu.  For now, use "m4
menu2mgr.m4" to load the menu.

A prototype of a m4 script which produces OCL code is provided in
menu2ocl.m4.
