=> This is the Bellcore Internal $HOME MOVIE release of MGR.
	I expect the public
	release to be virtually the same, except the Makefiles still need more work,
	and the installation instructions need some more detail

=> The significant changes over the previous release are listed in PATCH_3.

=> The easiest way to install MGR is to say (as root):
		make INSROOT=/usr/mgr TARGET=portmgr FLAG=-O install
	This makes a monochrome MGR in /usr/mgr, and all of the utilities.
		make INSROOT=/usr/mgr installman
	installs all of the man pages

=> To make a color version of mgr (after the mono version has been made)
		cd src; make clean clobber; make colormgr FLAG=-O INSROOT=/usr/mgr
	and copy the resultant mgr binary to $INSROOT/bin as color_mgr.

=> Make sure to run set_colormap before starting color_mgr

=> The $HOME MOVIE stuff is in demo/movie.  Look in demo/movie/demo for a
	sample movie.
