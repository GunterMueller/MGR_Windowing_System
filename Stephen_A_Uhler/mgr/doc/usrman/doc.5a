.Sh page Functions
The functions listed below have packaged common sequences of
.I macro
calls together to provide a slightly higher level of interface than the
macros alone.  They are still low level, and have no pretense of
completeness. Except where noted, all of the functions return a value
greater than zero on success, and a value less than zero upon failure.
The functions fail only if they read an unexpected value from \*M.
Client programs may use the function
.Fr m_lastline
in an attempt to determine what input caused the failure.
Those functions which expect data from \*M automatically flush any
pending output before reading, and unless the 
.I M_MODEOK
flag is set,
attempt to turn off character echoing
to prevent data returned by \*M from echoing back on the window.
.LP
.RS
.Fd void
.Fr ckmgrterm message
.Fs ckmgrterm\(dg "Check to see if \*M is running"
.br
char\*A message
.Ft
This function prints
.Fi message
and exits
if the TERM environment variable is set to a string other than 
.I mgr .
Otherwise it returns.
.Fd "BITMAP \*A"
.Fr bitmapread file_pointer 
.Fs bitmapread\(dg 7 "Read an \*M bitmap from a file"
.br
FILE\*A file_pointer;
.Ft
The file pointed to by
.Fi file_pointer
is read and converted into an \*M bitmap.
The return value of NULL indicates failure.
This is the identical routine \*M uses to read bitmap files, so use it.
The external integer
.Fi bitmap_compressed
is set if the bitmap was compressed.
.Fd int
.Fr bitmapwrite file_pointer  bitmap   flag
.Fs bitmapwrite\(dg 7 "Write an \*M bitmap to a file"
.br
FILE\*A file_pointer;
.br
BITMAP\*A bitmap;
.br
int flag;
.br
This function is used by \*M to write the \*M bitmap 
pointed to by
.Fi bitmap
into the file pointed to by
.Fi file_pointer .
The
.Fi flag
armument is used to indicate which style of bitmap to write.
If 
.Fi flag
is one, the new style format is used.  
If flag is 0, old style bitmaps are created.
New style bitmaps are recommended.

.Fd int
.Fr get_eachclientwin windatap
.Fs get_eachclientwin\(dg 7 "Get window parameters for each window"
.br
struct window_data \*Awindatap;
.Ft
Get the window parameters for each window in the current window set,
one window at a time.
This function returns 1 if window_data structure has been filled,
0 otherwise.
It is important to call get_eachcleintwin() in a tight loop that
doesn't exit until it returns 0,
so that all the data is picked up.
This function is preferred to
.Fr get_client
 because you don't need to know the maximum number of windows you are likely
to see.
.Fd int
.Fr get_eachwin windatap
.Fs get_eachwin\(dg 7 "Get window parameters for each window"
.br
struct window_data \*Awindatap;
.Ft
Get the window parameters for all the windows,
one window at a time.
This function returns 1 if window_data structure has been filled,
0 otherwise.
It is important to call get_eachwin() in a tight loop that
doesn't exit until it returns 0,
so that all the data is picked up.
This function is preferred to
.Fr get_all
 because you don't need to know the maximum number of windows you are likely
to see.
.Fd int
.Fr get_font wide high 
.Fs get_font\(dg 7 "Get character font size"
.br

.Fs menu_load\(dg 8 "Down load a pop-up menu"
.br
int n;
int count;
struct menu_entry \*Atext;
.Ft
A menu is downloaded to \*M at position
.Fi n .
The integer 
.Fi count
is the number of menu items to be down-loaded, and
.Fi text
is an array of menu item/value pairs.
The structure
.I menu_entry
is defined in
.I term.h .
.Fd int
.Fr m_bitfile to name widep highp
.Fs m_bitfile\(dg 5 "Read a bitmap file into a scratchpad bitmap"
.br
int to;
char *name;
int *widep, *highp;
.Ft
Given a bitmap id,
.Fi to
and an icon 
.Fi name ,
have \*M load that icon into that scratchpad bitmap,
returning the icon width
and height, in pixels, via the given integer pointers.
Return a positive number if successful.
If the icon is not loaded, set the width and height values to 0 and
return 0.
This function is identical to
.Fr m_bitfromfile
plus the needed interception of the line returned from \*M.
.Fd void
.Fr m_bitload x y wide high data 
.Fs m_bitload\(dg 5 "Download an image into the window"
.br
int x,y;
int wide,high;
register char \*Adata;
.Ft
The bitmap image pointed at by
.Fi data
is down-loaded to the window
at position
.Fr ""  x  y
 in 
.I window
coordinates.
It is up to the client program to insure an 8 bit channel exists
between the client and \*M.
The integers
.Fi wide
and
.Fi high
specify the size of the bitmap in pixels.
.Fd char \*A
.Fr m_lastline  
.Fs m_lastline\(dg 1 "Retrieve the last line send from \*M for a library function"
.br
.Ft
The last input from \*M to a library function is returned.
The data is kept in a static buffer which is overwritten
at each request.
.Fd int
.Fr m_makewindow X Y Dwidth Dheight
.Fs m_makewindow\(dg 11 "Make an alternate window"
.br
int  X, Y, Dwidth, Dheight;
.Ft
An alternate window is created as the
.I active
window,
at display coordinates
.Fr "" X Y
 and of size
.Fi Dwidth
by
.Fi Dheight
pixels.
If the window is too big to fit on the display, its
width and height are truncated.
The alternate window's
.I window-id
is returned if the window was created successfully.
The macro
.Fr m_selectwin
 is used to write on the newly created window.
.Fd int
.Fr m_setup mode 
.Fs m_setup\(dg 1 "Initialize the library package"
.br
int mode;
.Ft
This function initializes the library.
It must be called before any other function or macro.
The argument
.Fi mode
is one or more of the flags
.SM
.I M_FLUSH ,
.I M_DEBUG ,
.LG
or
.SM
.I M_MODEOK
.LG
.I or -ed
together.
If 
.SM
.I M_FLUSH
.LG
is present, all macros and function flush output to \*M after each
macro call.  This is slightly less efficient than letting the client
program flush the data
(see
.Fr m_flush
 )
but prevent inadvertent buffering problems.
The 
.I M_DEBUG
flag forces the macro package to read and write from
.I stdin
and
.I stdout
respectively.
Normally
.I /dev/tty
is opened for reading and writing to permit standard input or output
redirection while still maintaining a connection to \*M.
If
.I /dev/tty
can not be opened, as would be the case for clients invoked through
.I rsh ,
the
.I M_DEBUG
flag is turned on,
and
.I stdin
and
.I stdout
are used instead.
The
.I M_MODEOK
flag instructs those functions which expect data from \*M
to assume the terminal modes are set appropriately.
Otherwise, the functions attempt to turn off character echoing and
turn on line mode before fetching data from \*M.
The functions
.Fr m_ttyset
 and
.Fr m_ttyreset
 can be used to set and reset the terminal modes.
The function
.Fr m_setup
 returns its argument, with the 
.I M_DEBUG
flag
.I or -ed
in if 
.I /dev/tty
can not be opened.
.Fd void
.Fr m_ttyreset  
.Fs m_ttyreset\(dg 1 "Reset the tty modes"
.br
.Ft
The terminal modes are restored to their state just
prior to the last call to 
.Fr m_ttyset 
\&.
Calls to 
.Fr m_ttyset
 and
.Fr m_ttyreset
 may be stacked up to ten levels.
.Fd int
.Fr m_ttyset  
.Fs m_ttyset\(dg 1 "Set the tty modes for proper \*M interaction"
.br
.Ft
The terminal is set in a state suitable for data exchange with \*M.
Character echoing is turned off, and line processing mode
is enabled.
The function returns zero (0) if it successfully retrieves the terminal
modes, -1 otherwise.
