This directory contains the MGR programmers manual.

The manual is made in two passes.  The first pass calculates the
function index and category sections, then the second pass prints the
document.

You might need to edit doc.0 to change the definition of the fonts
used for 'Ff' and 'Fn' to whatever you call your constant width roman
and bold fonts.

"make ver"	increments a version number to keep the copies straight
"make print"	prints the manual on a photocomposer
"make nroff"	prints the manual via nroff onto the stdout
"make"		runs ver, index, and print

INDEX				extracts the index from temp.index
