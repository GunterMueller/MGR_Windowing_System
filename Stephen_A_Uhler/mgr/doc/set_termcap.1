Prints on 
.I stdout
the
.I shell
commands required to set the
.B TERMCAP
environment variable appropriately for the current window size on a
.I mgr
terminal.
.I Set_termcap
looks at the
.B SHELL
environment variable to decide what shell commands are appropriate.
the command
.B eval `set_termcap`
sets the TERM and TERMCAP environment variables appropriately.
.LP
.I Set_emacs
optimizes the termcap entry for

which knows how to 
deal with scrolling regions and multiple line inserts and deletes,
whereas
.I set_termcap
keeps 
.B vi
happy.
