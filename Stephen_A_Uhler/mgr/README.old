Welcome to MGR.   MGR is an network transparent window system for Unix.  This
source contains the SUN version.  MGR has been ported to the Macintosh, and to
system V based unix machines. Look at the first few pages of
doc/usrman/usrman.out for a more detailed desciption of MGR.

misc		Sample startup files, misc. useful commands.
src		MGR source
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation notes:

*  MGR has 2 built-in path names; one to find fonts, the other to find icons.
   Both are set with INSROOT in the top level makefile, but may be
   over-ridden on the command line.

*  "make" builds mgr and all the demos and utilities. "make install", when
   run as root, put everything into the proper place.

*  MGR needs to run as root in order to "chown" your tty's.  Otherwise
   commands like "mesg" and "biff" don't work -- they require you own
   your tty, and the mgr ipc stuff breaks.

*  Some old versions of make (pre release 3.0) don't work on multi-level
   makefiles.  In such cases, run all of the sub makefiles by hand, 
   starting at the bottom.  Alternately you can use GNU-make from the
   Free Software Foundation (You need to remove the "#include <sys/types.h>"
   and move "#include <sys/param.h>" to be the 1'st include file) if gnu-make
   won't compile.

*  I've installed this release on the following SUNS:
      sun 2/120 running release 1.1
      sun 2/50 running release 2.3
      sun  3/50 3/75, 3/160, 3/260, 3/110, 3/60c running releases 3.0 to 4.0.
      This release used to work on the roadrunner (386 based SUN), but the
      C compiler dumps core on our current RR release.  Also on the 386, the
		internal format of bitmaps is different: you need to bit-swap every
		data byte of the fonts and icons.

*  To make and install MGR, become root and type:
      make INSROOT=<rootdir> TARGET=<which_mgr> install
   where <rootdir> is MGR's root directory, usually /usr/mgr and
   <which_mgr> specifies the version of mgr you want.  Common values for
   <which_mgr> are:
      prod		production version - debugging code omitted.
      color		color version
      sun2		sun2 version
      mgr	 	default version
   src/makefile has a complete list of $TARGET's
   Some of the demos don't work in color.

*  To make MGR's home directory in one place, then install it in a different
   place (presumably in anticipation of future symbolic links), do a
      make INSROOT=<mgr_looks_here>
   followed by a
      make INSROOT=<mgr_gets_put_here> install
   
*  Makefile Bugs
   When making the 'color' or other pixrect based versions of mgr (Normally
   MGR doesn't use pixrect; it has its own bitblit code) you need to add
	OTHERLIB=-lpixrect to the make command line.

*  MGR bugs.
   - The font format depends upon the underlying bitblit implementation,
     which is why 2 versions of the fonts are needed.  This should be fixed
     in the future, with the introduction of a more portable font format.
     Its currently not possible for the monochrome and color versions of
     MGR to share the same directory, as they each need a different font
     format.

   - The SUN color version of MGR is kludgy, due in part to the semantics
     of Sun's pixrect library.  If I ever get around to writing COLOR bitblit
     code, the color versions should go 2x faster.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*  When trying to run MGR, if you get:
   
   - can't find the screen
     make sure you have a /dev/bwtwo0, otherwise
     cd to /dev, and type "MAKEDEV bwtwo0" as root

   - can't get a ptty
     make sure all of /dev/[tp]ty[pq]? are owned by root, mode 666
     and all programs referenced with the "shell" option in the startup
     file exist and are executable

   - none but the default font, make sure MGR is looking in the right place.
     type "mgr -V" to find out where mgr is looking.

   - completely hung (not even the mouse track moves)
     login to your sun from another terminal (or rlogin) and kill the
     mgr process.

  "mgr -V" provides more configuration information than "mgr -v"

Acknowlegements:
   Many thanks to Mike Bianchi, who spent many hours fixing little bugs
   and helping to get all of this stuff into a coherent package.
